**Chefboost** is a lightweight [gradient boosting](https://sefiks.com/2018/10/04/a-step-by-step-gradient-boosting-decision-tree-example/), [random forest](https://sefiks.com/2017/11/19/how-random-forests-can-keep-you-from-decision-tree/) and [adaboost](https://sefiks.com/2018/11/02/a-step-by-step-adaboost-example/) enabled decision tree framework including regular [ID3](https://sefiks.com/2017/11/20/a-step-by-step-id3-decision-tree-example/), [C4.5](https://sefiks.com/2018/05/13/a-step-by-step-c4-5-decision-tree-example/), [CART](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/27/a-step-by-step-cart-decision-tree-example/) and [regression tree](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/28/a-step-by-step-regression-decision-tree-example/) algorithms **with categorical features support**. It is lightweight, you just need to write **a few lines of code** to build decision trees with Chefboost.
 
# Documentation

This YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsS_1RYmYQQHp_xZObt76dpacY543GrJD) guides you how to use Chefboost step by step for different algorithms. You can also find the detailed documentations about these core algorithms [here](https://sefiks.com/tag/decision-tree/). 

Besides, you can enroll this online course - [**Decision Trees for Machine Learning From Scratch**](https://www.udemy.com/course/decision-trees-for-machine-learning/?referralCode=FDC9B836EC6DAA1A663A) and follow the curriculum if you wonder the theory of decision trees and how this framework is developed.
